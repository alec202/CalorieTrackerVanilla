# CalorieTrackerVanilla
A health Calorie Tracker using vanilla tools

# Where at
Currently I'm working on the front end for the login page.

# App Structure Content

## Color Scheme 
The color scheme I decided on was having the body page background be: #fffdd0
Have the widgets like buttons be: #cc5500 (tan orange)
Have the actual content be: #014f86 (dark blue) and text color within the content to be #ffffff (white).

# Next Steps
- [ X ] Pick a color scheme
- [ ] Center the login container box
- [ ] update the backgroun of the login container box and the background of the body element so it looks more "modern"
- [ ] Change the forgot password button to be a text link instead of a normal button and put the textdirectly underneath the password input box. See Microsoft account login example.
