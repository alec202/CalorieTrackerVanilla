function login() {
    const loginForm = document.getElementsByClassName("login");
    // we could use the class to get the elements. First lets console.log(loginForm.elements) to see what it gives us. Maybe we can use the DOM tree
    // probs wouldn't be used IRL because anytime we change the DOM we would need to update this JS code.
